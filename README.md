# Homelab

Welcome to my raspberry pi homelab. My goal was to incorporate git tracking, and create a CICD pipeline to add some security to spruce up my homelab setup.

## To Do

- Network-tools
    - Unbound
- Monitoring
- CICD
    - CVE scanning
    - Port scanning
    - Linting/validation
- Ansible ?
    - Big pain point for me in the past, but standardizing my dependencies in one place would be really nice (as well as deal with things like ssh hardening, port security, etc)
